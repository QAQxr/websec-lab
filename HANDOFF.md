# WebSec Lab Handoff

## Document Purpose

This is the current handoff and status document for WebSec Lab. Update it after every phase, design correction, verification run, or known-issue change.

**Last updated:** 2026-09-06

**Project path:** `~/opencode/projects/websec-lab`

**GitHub repository:** `https://github.com/QAQxr/websec-lab`

## Current Status

**Current phase:** Phase 2.1 complete

**Active work:** None. The Phase 2.1 Docker stack is currently running.

**Next allowed phase:** Phase 2.2, only after explicit approval

**Intentional vulnerabilities:** None implemented

**Working tree:** Clean at the last handoff verification; update this line if new uncommitted work appears.

**Branch:** `main`

**Current commit:** `2ff431b Add project handoff document`

**Remote state:** Local `main` and `origin/main` are synchronized at `2ff431b`.

## What Has Been Completed

### Design

The initial `PROJECT_DESIGN.md` was reviewed against the six implementation-readiness requirements.

The design now specifies:

* Docker/network isolation as the primary egress boundary.
* `LAB_EGRESS=deny` as an application-level experiment guard only.
* No public Nginx `/uploads/` path.
* Flask file authorization before future file delivery.
* MySQL for integration/security behavior; SQLite only for pure unit tests.
* Route -> Service -> Policy -> Repository responsibilities.
* Lab-only identifiers such as `LAB-SQLI-001` instead of CVE-like identifiers.
* Phase 2.1 infrastructure separated from future Phase 2.2 application work.

### Phase 2.1 Infrastructure

Implemented:

* Docker Compose services: Nginx, Flask web, MySQL, Redis, internal-api.
* Basic Flask landing page at `/`.
* JSON health endpoint at `/health`.
* Private internal-api endpoint at `/internal/health`.
* Web-to-MySQL connectivity check.
* Web-to-Redis connectivity check.
* Web-to-internal-api connectivity check.
* Deterministic MySQL bootstrap marker.
* Named volumes for MySQL, Redis, uploads, and mail data.
* Non-root web and internal-api containers.
* Read-only application containers with temporary filesystems.
* No Docker socket, home directory, SSH key, or credential mounts.
* Reset script that recreates the stack and named volumes.
* Container integration tests and pure configuration unit tests.

## Runtime Topology

```text
Browser
  |
  | 127.0.0.1:8080
  v
Nginx
  | host_ingress (Nginx only)
  | proxy_private (internal)
  v
Flask web
  | proxy_private (internal)
  | app_private (internal)
  +--> MySQL
  +--> Redis
  `--> internal-api
```

Private networks use:

```text
internal: true
com.docker.network.bridge.inhibit_ipv4: "true"
```

The first option removes the default external route. The second prevents the host from routing directly to private container IPs. `host_ingress` is intentionally non-internal because Docker cannot publish the loopback Nginx port from an internal bridge network.

Only this host mapping exists:

```text
127.0.0.1:8080 -> nginx:80
```

MySQL, Redis, and internal-api have no host port mappings.

## Current Runtime State

Expected healthy services:

```text
websec-lab-nginx-1
websec-lab-web-1
websec-lab-mysql-1
websec-lab-redis-1
websec-lab-internal-api-1
```

Active named volumes:

```text
websec_lab_mysql_data
websec_lab_redis_data
websec_lab_uploads
websec_lab_mail
```

An obsolete network named `websec_lab_public_edge` remains from the initial topology attempt. It is not used by the current Compose file.

## How To Run

From the project root:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8080/
http://127.0.0.1:8080/health
```

Run tests:

```bash
docker compose --profile test run --rm test-runner
./scripts/verify_phase21.sh
```

Reset the disposable local state:

```bash
./scripts/reset.sh
```

The reset removes this Compose project's named volumes and recreates the stack. It does not remove unrelated Docker resources.

Stop without deleting volumes:

```bash
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```

## Verification Baseline

The following checks have passed after a reset:

* `docker compose up -d` starts all services.
* Nginx landing page returns AcmeCloud/WebSec Lab HTML.
* `/health` returns database, Redis, and internal-api status `ok`.
* Nginx does not expose `/internal/health`.
* Container integration and unit tests: `6 passed`.
* Host and network verification script passes.
* Direct host TCP access to the actual MySQL, Redis, and internal-api container IPs is blocked.
* Web container cannot fetch `http://example.com`.
* Reset recreates the database bootstrap state and passes the same checks.

The host has an unrelated listener on `127.0.0.1:3306`. The WebSec Lab Compose project does not publish MySQL; the verification script reports this external listener without treating it as the lab service.

## Known Issues and Risks

* Phase 2.1 is saved on GitHub; future changes must be pushed explicitly when a phase is ready.
* `websec_lab_public_edge` is an obsolete cleanup candidate.
* Docker Compose reports that buildx is not installed and uses the fallback builder.
* Active MySQL and Redis volume sizes have not been measured separately.
* No user registration, authentication, sessions, projects, files, messages, comments, admin area, or REST business API exists yet.
* No learning mode, challenge mode, audit mode, PoC, patch, or vulnerability test exists yet.
* No intentional SQLi, XSS, CSRF, IDOR, SSRF, upload, traversal, command injection, SSTI, XXE, deserialization, race, or authorization flaw has been added.

## Commit History

| Commit | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `88ea430` | Initial `PROJECT_DESIGN.md` |
| `5f961f9` | Readiness corrections for Phase 2.1 safety and scope |
| `35625e5` | Corrected Nginx host-ingress topology |
| `ab720c7` | Added strict private bridge isolation |
| `99e2ab3` | Implemented Phase 2.1 infrastructure baseline |
| `2ff431b` | Added project handoff document and saved Phase 2.1 state |

## Next Work

Do not start Phase 2.2 automatically. The next implementation plan should be reviewed and explicitly approved first.

Recommended Phase 2.2 order:

1. Add the minimal application data model and deterministic seed.
2. Add registration, simulated email verification, login, logout, and session display.
3. Add MySQL integration tests for authentication and session lifecycle.
4. Add a minimal dashboard and project CRUD without intentional vulnerabilities.
5. Re-run the full Phase 2.1 regression suite after each increment.

Do not introduce vulnerability behavior until the normal business workflow is stable and a separate phase is approved.

## Handoff Procedure

The next agent should:

1. Read this document and `PROJECT_DESIGN.md`.
2. Check `git status --short --branch` before editing.
3. Check `docker compose ps` before restarting or resetting services.
4. Preserve the three-network topology and private-network verification.
5. Keep integration/security tests on MySQL.
6. Keep vulnerability work out of Phase 2.1 and Phase 2.2 core business implementation.
7. Update this document and the task audit log after meaningful changes.
